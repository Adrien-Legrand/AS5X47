# AS5X47
A library for Arduino boards that reads angles from AS5047 and AS5147 sensors. Also handles encoder configuration.

Provides a very easy interface for reading the encoder angle.

All registers of the encoder are also accessible, read and write operations are implemented.
Please refer to the Manufacturer datasheet for detailed information about the registers.

This library has been tested with Arduino IDE 1.8.5 under Windows and Arduino IDE 1.8.12 under Ubuntu.
